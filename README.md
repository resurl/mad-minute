my sister is really slow at her times tables and i thought flashcards weren't as effective as mad minute tests were for me in elementary school, so i made this to replicate it

todo:
- must display results after end of quiz
- test what happens when you run out of questions (finished all questions before time runs out)
- better UI/UX (home buttons, pressing 'start' automatically selects the answer box, make it prettier. will think of more)
- customizability (customize # of questions in question bank, go beyond 12 times table)
- flash cards side of web app, basically anki style flashcards of times table
