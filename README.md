my sister is really slow at her times tables and i thought flashcards weren't as effective as mad minute tests were for me in elementary school, so i made this to replicate it

built using javascript/nodejs on the front-end and back-end, pug as a template engine, and express for the server-side of things.

todo:
- customizability (customize # of questions in question bank, go beyond 12 times table)
- flash cards side of web app, similar to test mode but unlimited time and mix of flashcards and mc (like quizlet)
